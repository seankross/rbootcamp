## What is R?

R is a general purpose programming language. If you've heard about Python, Ruby,
C, or JavaScript, R can do anything any of those languages can do. The advantage
that R has over these languages is that R is specifically designed for working
with data.

## Installing R

R is as easy to install as a web browser. You can install the latest version of
R from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). After you download and install R
you should also install RStudio, which is a computer program that will help you
write R code. You can download RStudio 
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
