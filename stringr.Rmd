### Basic String Functions

We've been dealig with strings for a while now, but before we proceed there are
two basic functions that deal with strings that you should be aware of. The
first is `paste()` which pastes strings together. A few examples of using
paste are below:

```{r}
paste("It was the best of times", "it was the worst of times")

paste("It was the", c("best", "worst"))

paste("It was the", c("best", "worst"), "of times")

paste("It was the best of times", "it was the worst of times", sep = ", ")

paste(c("best", "worst"), collapse = "")

paste("It was the", c("best", "worst"), collapse = "")
```

Another generally useful string function is `nchar()`, which counts the number
of characters in a string.

```{r}
nchar("Hello, it's me")
nchar(c("I", "was", "wondering", "if", "after", "all", "these", "years", "you'd", "like", "to", "meet"))
```

### Regular expressions

(For context, Perl is a programming language)

![xkcd Perl Problems](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/perl_problems.png)

In extraordinarily broad terms data is stored on computers either as binary data
or as text. The practical difference between these two methods of storing data
is that text is comprehensible to the human eye. Although a dataset might be
comprehensible to your eye, it may not be comprehensible to a computer. In
order to make text data comprehensible to a computer, data often needs to be
cleaned.

Data can often be cleaned programmatically, in other words, often you can write
a computer program (an R function) to systematically clean data. You can get
text data into R using `readLines()` which returns a character vector where
each element of the vector is a line of the text file you provided as an
argument. You might want to search these strings for patterns so that you can
manipulate those patterns somehow. 

Regular expressions are a feature that are built into many programming langauges
that can be used for searching strings. You can create a regular expression by
combining metacharacters, some of which are listed below.


### Metacharacters

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)

ch <- c("\\\\\\\\", ".", "*", "?", "+", "{x}", "{x,}", "{x,y}", "[abc]", "[^abc]",
        "[a-z]", "[^a-z]", "a|b", "\\\\\\\\d", "\\\\\\\\D", "\\\\\\\\s", 
        "\\\\\\\\S", "\\\\\\\\w", "\\\\\\\\W",
        "^", "$")
ex <- c("Specifies a metacharacter",
        "Any character",
        "PE zero or more times",
        "PE zero or one times",
        "PE one or more times",
        "PE x times",
        "PE x or more times",
        "PE x or more and y or fewer times",
        "Any characters within the brackets",
        "Any characters except those between the brackets",
        "Any characters between a and z",
        "Any characters except those between a and z",
        "a or b",
        "Any digit", "Any non-digit", "Any space", "Any non-space", "Any 'word'",
        "Any 'non-word'", "Start of string", "End of string")

kable(
  data.frame(
    Character = ch,
    Explanation = ex
  )
)
```

### Using Regular Expressions in R

The `grep()` function takes two arguments, a pattern, and text to search.

```
grep
grepl
sub
gsub
```

```{r}
grepl("\\B", c("aa", "b", "c", "."))
```

### `stringr`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(stringr)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_count()
str_detect()
str_dup()
str_extract()
str_match()
str_replace()
str_split()
str_to_lower()
str_to_title()
str_to_upper()
str_trim()
```

```{r}
thanks_path <- file.path(R.home("doc"), "THANKS")
thanks <- str_c(readLines(thanks_path), collapse = "\n")
thanks <- word(thanks, 1, 3, fixed("\n\n"))
cat(str_wrap(thanks), "\n")
cat(str_wrap(thanks, width = 40), "\n")
cat(str_wrap(thanks, width = 60, indent = 2), "\n")
cat(str_wrap(thanks, width = 60, exdent = 2), "\n")
cat(str_wrap(thanks, width = 0, exdent = 2), "\n")
```
