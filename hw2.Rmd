After Lecture 3 you should complete the following swirl lessons in the
Exploratory Data Analysis course:

- Principles of Analytic Graphs
- Exploratory Graphs
- Graphics Devices in R
- Plotting Systems
- Base Plotting System

Before starting this swirl course you should install a few packages by taking
these steps:

1. Run `install.packages("Rcpp")`.
2. You will be asked `Do you want to install from sources the package which 
needs compilation?`. Type `n` into the R console and then press enter.
3. Download [this](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/ggplot2_1.0.1.tar.gz)
file.
4. Run `install.packages(file.choose(), repos = NULL, type="source")` and
select the file you just downloaded.
5. Run `install.packages("jpeg")`.

You should now have no problems with the lessons in the Exploratory Data 
Analysis course.
